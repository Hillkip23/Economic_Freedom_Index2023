# Economic_Freedom_Index2023


This is a Streamlit app that displays the Index of Economic Freedom for different countries. The app has two tabs - the first tab allows users to select a country from a dropdown menu and displays the 2023 score for that country, while the second tab displays a bar chart of the top countries by economic freedom.

The app loads data from an Excel file called 'index2023_data.xlsx'. If the file is not found, the app displays an error message. The app also checks that the '2023 Score' column is present in the DataFrame. If the column is not present, the app displays an error message.

To run the app locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip. Run the app using the command streamlit run app.py.

The app can be customized by modifying the Excel file with data for different countries and years. The app can also be extended to include additional features, such as a map visualization or a search function for finding specific countries.
